INTERPLANETARY FINANCIAL
American Peoples Coin
Prepared for The People
INTRODUCTION:
My name is Dylan Clarke,
I am the soon to be President of Interplanetary Financial and the creator of this Token.
Raymond Dew Soon to be(CEO),
We will be incorperating within 8-12 months.
We live in 1 / 4 Tabrett street, West Kempsey, NSW 2440, Australia. We both Have Asperger's
and care about all people no matter where they are from and the future of this planet.
I made this Token to help provide relief For the Native American People and to Fund our
business ventures which we will always give at least 30% of everything We earn to help others,

Our Initiative
American/Native Investment.
Our main goal for this initiative is for the federal government to invest in Indigenous
communities in every aspect of their lives, calling for an end to Indigenous poverty, reservations
and improving the lives of Americans. I believe that the concept of reservations was founded on
the grounds of racist ideologies and is therefore irrelevant in our modern society.
Reservations are a failed system almost akin to Jewish ghettos used during World War II in
Europe, the conditions in which some American citizens live because of the color of their skin is
a stain on the American constitution and the values of which it stands.
We need a new level of understanding to raise consciousness and for humankind to evolve and
be more understanding of each other's differences, I believe the United States Government
should aim to fund Indigenous learning programs designed to teach young students that
Indigenous history is American history.
We propose that the government introduces Indigenous languages and culture as an optional
national curriculum for young students, we believe that the Indigenous youth should be taught
that they are as much of an American citizen as anyone else, they have the right to be patriotic
and should be able to meld with mainstream American culture, whilst being distinct.
We also wish to reduce the dropout and unemployment rates of Indigenous citizens, we would
like to advise the federal government to increase investment in suicide prevention programs,
according to The Office of Minority Health, as of 2019 suicide was the second leading of death
among American Indian/Alaska Native teenagers, until reservations are dismanteled we would
like to petition the government to stop infrastructure projects on Indigenous lands.
furthermore,
The U.S. is currently far too dependent on imports such as electronics etc. This is why we
believe It would be a better strategy to increase local production of electronics and other
goods, considering the rise of hostile nations like China and the threat of a possible impending
war, dependence on these hostile nations during these unstable times would be an unwise
decision on behalf of the American people.
As President Biden has stated during the rise of Russia and the subsequent invasion of Ukraine
that we need a ''New world order'' to prevent hostile eastern nations from turning the tide of
influence from western powers to the east.
We think The U.S. government should also consider introducing a single-payer healthcare
system that would cover every citizen's medical needs and should also implement free college
tuition fees for low-income families or perhaps even abolish them entirely.
We would like the federal government to declare a national holiday commemorating all
cultures and ethnicities.
We wish to emphasise that we are directing this message to people of all political
denominations e.g. Republicans, and Democrats.
The 30% profit from this token will be going directly to the American programs and the
comunity.
Yours faithfully,
President Dylan John Clarke.
There are going to be 100,000,000 Tokens minted
